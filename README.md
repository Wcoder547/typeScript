# TypeScript from Basic to Advanced

&#x20;This repository provides a **comprehensive guide to TypeScript**, covering everything from the fundamentals to advanced concepts. Each chapter focuses on a key topic (from basic setup and types to generics, classes, interfaces, etc.) and includes an `instructions.txt` file with theory notes, practical examples, and interview-style questions. The content is carefully structured for **beginners, intermediate developers, and students** to learn and reinforce TypeScript skills.

## Topics Covered

- **Basic Concepts & Setup:** Introduction to TypeScript, environment setup (Node.js, tsconfig), and fundamental types (number, string, boolean).
- **Arrays & Configuration:** Working with TypeScript arrays, and configuring the TypeScript compiler (tsconfig.json).
- **Generics:** Understanding generic types and how to use them for flexible, type-safe functions and classes.
- **Readonly & Optional:** Using `readonly` modifiers and optional properties in interfaces/types to create immutable and flexible data structures.
- **Tuples:** Learning about tuple types, how they differ from arrays, and advanced tuple usage.
- **Type Aliases:** Defining custom type aliases for cleaner code and reusability.
- **`any` vs `unknown`:** Exploring the differences between `any` and `unknown` types and best practices for type safety.
- **Classes:** Introduction to object-oriented programming in TypeScript, including classes, inheritance, and access modifiers.
- **Interfaces:** Defining object shapes, implementing interfaces in classes, and interface inheritance.
- **Union & Intersection Types:** Using union and intersection types to compose complex type definitions.

Each topic folder contains clear examples, code snippets, and an `instructions.txt` file that guides you through the concepts with explanations, practical exercises, and interview preparation questions.

## Setup & Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Wcoder547/Your-Repo-Name.git
   ```

2. **Install TypeScript (if needed):** Ensure you have Node.js installed, then run:

   ```bash
   npm install -g typescript
   ```

3. **Compile the code:** Navigate to any chapter folder and compile the TypeScript file:

   ```bash
   tsc index.ts
   ```

   This will generate an `index.js` JavaScript file in the same folder.

4. **Run the output:** Execute the compiled code with Node.js:

   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

5. **Explore & Learn:** Open the `instructions.txt` in each folder to read theory, follow along with the examples, and try the exercises.

## Who Is This For?

- **Beginners:** New to TypeScript or coming from JavaScript and want a structured path to learn TypeScript basics.
- **Intermediate Developers:** Familiar with TypeScript basics and looking to solidify knowledge of advanced features and best practices.
- **Students:** Preparing for coding interviews or enhancing academic learning with real-world TypeScript examples.

**Prerequisites:** A basic understanding of JavaScript (ES6+) and Node.js will help you make the most of this content.
